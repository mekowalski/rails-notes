Rails forms gives ability to submit data into form fields
  -create new DB records, build contact form, integrate search engine field, etc

#routes.rb file
resources :dogs, only: [:index, :new]

#DogsController
def new
end

#views/dogs/new.html.erb
<form>
  <label>Dog Name: </label><br>
  <input type='text' id='dog_name' name='dog[name]'><br>

  <label>About this dog: </label><br>
  <textarea id='dog_description' name='dog[description]'></textarea><br>

  <input type='submit' value='Submit Info'>
</form>

<%= params.inspect %>

-Traditionally, Rails apps use model[attribute] syntax for name attributes eg: dog[name]

-Need to update form tag with an 'action' attribute AND a method attribute to submit data via POST http verb
<form action='<%= dogs_path %>' method='POST'>

-Then build a 'create' route for the routing system knows what to do when a POST request is sent
#config.rb
resources :dogs, only: [:index, :new, :create]


CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery
-log into your bank site, after logging in & checking account balance, you open another tab to another site
-unknowingly, the other site is actually a hacking site running scripts in the background as soon as you get
 to the landing page
-one of the scripts hijacks the banking session that is open in the previous tab & submits a form to transfer
 money
-banking form can't differentiate whether request is made by logged in user or not, therefore processes the
 transaction to the one who made the request

-Rails blocks CSRF by requiring unique auth token to be submitted each forms
-integrate form_authenticity_token helper into form as hidden field
<form...>...
  label...
  input...
  ...

  <input type='hidden' name='authenticity_token' value='<%= form_authenticity_token %>'>
  submit...
</form>


Using form helpers
-ActionView provides helper methods to assist streamlining view template code, improve the form
 integrating form_tag element
<%= form_tag dogs_path do %>
  label...
  input...

  label br...
  textarea...

  <%= hidden_field_tag :authenticity_token, form_authenticity_token %>
  input submit...
<% end %>
