Create, C in CRUD life cycle
-saves new Model object and redirects to newly created show page

#DogsController
-create new Dog instance
-pass params from form
-save the record

def create
  dog = Dog.new
  dog.name = params[:name]
  dog.description = params[:description]
  dog.save
end

^^going to /digs/new will give a 'Template is missing' error
-Therefore refactor code to leverage route helper method
-Refactor variable into an instance variable

def create
  @dog = Dog.new
  @dog.name = params[:name]
  @dog.description = params[description]
  @dog.save
  redirect_to dog_path(@dog) <---redirect to new resource's show page
end
