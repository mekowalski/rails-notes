JOIN MODEL FORMS
-When filling out a form, given the option to choose from a dropdown and this assigns properties directly to
 the new instance created
-Other times abstraction is needed
 eg: a beer_style has many companies and a company has many beer_styles
 ^^^create join table called: beer_style_companies(this doesn't make sense to me)


SETTING UP BEERSTYLES AND COMPANIES
eg:
class BeerStyle < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :beer_style_companies
  has_many :companies, through: :beer_style_companies
end

class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :beer_style_companies
  has_many :beer_styles, through: :beer_style_companies
end

class BeerStyleCompany < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :beer_style
  belongs_to :company
end

-This helps assign companies to a beer style with created
-With previous example WITHOUT join table, a foreign key was assigned

***see this is where i don't think it works. my beer model has 2 foreign keys of beer style and company. the
latter 2 models do not have any foreign keys. it doesn't makes sense for beer to have many beer styles but
beer styles may have many individual beers***
