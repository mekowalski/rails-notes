PARTIALS
-View level files that only form one part of HTML page
-Helps to DRY code and add better organization to code in views
-Duplication is twice the amount of code to maintain, twice opportunities for bugs and non-consistent
 interface with forms

1. Create file in app/views/beers/ called _form.html.erb
   *see app/views/beers*
2. Remove(copy) dupe code from both new and edit form files
3. Paste dupe code into _form.html.erb
4. new and edit should have render 'form'

THINGS TO NOTE
1. duplicate code with <% end %> in new and edit form and not moved into the partial
  ^^^this did not work for me. i had to include <% end %> in my partial. i want to think it's because i have
  a form_for and not a form_tag, which lesson states is the case

2. Can name partial as desired, its only requirement is that it begins with and underscore.  Good to name
  partials as common sensical as possible

3. No need to reference partial with directory considering the partial is in the same folder of new/edit
  views, referencing a partial housed in the same folder
  eg: <%= render 'form' %>
  If referencing a partial from a different dir then you must include folder name as well
  eg: <%= render 'otherdirectory/partialname' %>
