Two ways to pre-fill forms in Rails: form_tag and form_for
-Rerender the :new template without throwing away the invalid instance

eg:
def create
  @beer = Beer.new(beer_params)
  if @beer.valid?
    @beer.save
    redirect_to beers_path(@beer)
  else
    render :new
    //line 2
  end
end

-Use invalid instance to 're-fill' the usually-empty :new form with the invalid entries to save from retyping
-won't always want this, say with credit card #
