As of HTML5, forms officially do not support DELETE and PATCH for their methods
FORM_TAG() behavior is a workaround implemented by Rails itself
  -Use of correct rrequest methods for their corresponding goals, (GET for read, PATCH for update, etc)
  -maintain sanity and not worry about W#C drama while writing views

def destroy
  Beer.find(params[:id]).destroy
  redirect_to beers_path
end
*method chaining to immediately destroy found instance*

Can either go to show page to delete instance
Or delete from a list:

/app/views/beers/index.html.erb

<% beers.each do |beer| %>
<div class='beer'>
  <span><%= beer.name %></span>
  <%= link_to 'DELETE', beer, method: :DELETE, data: {confirm: 'Are you sure you wan to delete?'} %>
</div>
<% end %>

DATA-METHOD :DELETE will submit a DELETE request as if a form had been submitted
DATA-CONFIRM pops up to confirm before link is followed, allowing user to make sure they're ready to delete
  and instance forever
