-Rails is very pattern oriented
-Rails is a giant framework, level up from Sinatra
-Key Differences
  -Routing is DSL(domain specific language) separate from controllers
    routing is part of a routing file (config/routes.rb)
    define all routes and maps them to controllers#actions

  -controller actions are Ruby methods, no DSL
    controllers#actions become Ruby methods, not macros like in Sinatra

  -explicit and implicit view rendering
    an empty action in the controller will implicitly render(eg: dogs#show will automatically render)

  -instrumentation and generators
    Rails apps comes with an immense amount of instrumentation

  -ActionView
    Rails provides actionview helpers to automatically generate HTML instead of manually writing
    knows about Ruby, ActiveRecord, Rails pattern

  -Asset Pipeline
    for JavaScript and CSS
