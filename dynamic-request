Dynamic Routes, breakdown of dynamic route process flow:
  1. routes.rb file takes request & processes is like normal except it also parses the :id param & passes
     it through controller
     eg: /dogs/12, id:12
  2. the controller action will parse the :id param and run query on the Dog model, storing the result in
     an instance variable
  3. controller passes instance variable to associated view, renders details of the specific record for
     the client

Static: render pages that have hard coded path connected
  eg: /welcome path will always show the welcome page

Dynamic: render different data based on the params passed to route
  eg: 12 is passed as a param to /dogs/:id route, app should render data for dog with id of 12
