Scoping Routes
-Eventually, with direct routes that are grouped, the code becomes repetitive
-If specified routes need to be grouped under /thisgroup, Scope helps
-Scope: allows prefixing a block of routes under one grouping
*i don't have a legitimate use of this in my application but i will still provide examples*
