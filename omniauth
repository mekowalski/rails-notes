-Passwords are terrible for a few reasons
  1. You have to remember them, or user a pw manager
  2. On the server, all the passwords have to be managed
  3. Server-stored pws are not secure
  4. Manage pw changes, email verification and pw recovery

-If this was another entity's problem:
(Github, Facebook, Google, etc)
-The location in the world, the operating system being run, and numerous factors are being considered when
 being logged in via third party

OMNIAUTH
-Gem for Rails that allows use of multiple authentication providers alongside traditional username/pw setup

How OmniAuth works from User's standpoint
  1. User is redirected to a login page from yoursite.com
  2. Login page offers creating an account or login via Google or Twitter
  3. User clicks Login with Google, will briefly send user to /auth/google redirect for Google login page
  4. If user isn't already Google signed-in, they'll sign in and Google asks permission for yoursite.com
     to access user info
  5. If user agrees, they're redirected to /auth/google/callback and from there to the initial page they
     tried to access
