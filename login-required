MANUAL CHECKS
-From technical perspective, what does a user login actually mean?
-When a user logs in, their cookies are added to their user_id in their session
-User specifications should be present to them only(name, uploads, recent additions, etc)

eg: beer example, beers#show

def show
  @beer = Beer.find(params[:])
end

NEW REQUIREMENT FOR WHEN A USER LOGS IN
def show
  return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
  @beer = Beer.find(params[:id])
end
