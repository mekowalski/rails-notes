Rails system has a great amount of generators to do the manual labor, instead of creating DB tables,
configuring views, drawing individual routes and bug prone features

Rails Generators
-Setup basic specs for app's test suite, won't write complex logic tests but will provide basic examples
-Same way each time, standardize code & enables dev to be more efficient
-It follows Rails RESTful naming patterns, removes dupe code, uses partials, etc

Abusing Generators
-Should use a generator only when the task requires it
  eg: chainsaw is a great tool but you wouldn't use it for every task around the house such as cleaning

-Certain G's create a bit more code than necessary

RAILS GENERATE
-all Rails generators are entered as commands into terminal with syntax:
  rails generate <name of generator> <options> --no-test-framework
  or rails g (for short)

MIGRATION G
-Rails migration has great setup of conventions to help manage DB schema efficiently
-eg: terminal command - rails g migration AddNewAttributeToBeers
-Alter DB schema overtime, as a new 'version' of the DB


MODEL G
-This G is used regularly to create core code needed to create a model & associated DB table
-eg: terminal command - rails g model Style name:string --no-test-framework
-Creates DB migration adding a table and column(s)
-Adds a model file that will inherit from ActiveRecord::Base
