Validations in Controller Actions
-use info to help user fix typos or other issues in form submissions
-User fills ot form and hits Submit transmitting form data via POST request
-Controller sees validations have fails and re-renders form
-View displays errors to the user

Manually Checking Validations
-If the object is invalid, there will be no SHOW path to redirect
-The instance will never save to DB therefore _path will result in 404
-If redirect, new page starts to load, losing all the feedback from validations


Page Loads
-full page load occudrs when form is submitted
-all the variables set by controllers #new will disappear and are unavailable to #create
-Rails throws everything out after each request except for the session hash

eg:
def create
  @beer = Beer.new(beer_params)
  if @beer.valid?
    @beer.save

    redirect_to beer_path(beer)
  else
    render :new //instructed to render templates from other actions
  end
end
