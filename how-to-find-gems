Gems previously used(to name a few):
  -RSpec testing

  -OmniAuth for login via third party

  -Rails for all things rails, to create a full-stack framework for applications

DO YOU NEED A GEM
-Gems are available for use in everyone's projects, setting Ruby apart from other languages
-A side effect is: Gem Madness-where gems are used to solve every problem without consideration of actual gem
 usage

WHERE TO LOOK
-In console: `gem search` command takes a regular expression(regex) that is handy when a name or part of a
 name of a gem is known
-The Ruby Toolbox is a great site that collects and sorts rems by rank of:
 downloads, releases and active commits
-TRT is comprehensive to sift through, great for exploring all options
-Awesome Ruby and Awesome Rails Gem are 2 open sources, community-maintained lists of the most popular gems
 for Ruby and Rails by category
