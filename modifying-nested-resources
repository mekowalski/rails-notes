Create new beer that is automatically linked to a Company
-When on the Company's page, user should have the option to build new beer associated with that company
-Nested resources in routes
-Give access to /companies/:id/beers/new and a new_company_beer_path helper
 *rake routes for URL helper name*

Modify nested resource
  *refer to beers app*
  1. Update beers#new to handle :company_id parameter
  2. Modify companies/show with link_to nested new beer


HANDLING MISCHIEF AND ERRORS IN URLs
-Open up potential bugs, opportunites for playful users to mess up data(via edit)
*i didn't include the edit nesting only new*
-Check and make sure(#edit) that:
  1. the foreign_key_id is valid
  2. the instance matches the correct parent (beer(18) matches parent company(3))

-check existence of params[:foreign_key_id] to know it comes from nested routes
-if the parent is not present then flash alert
