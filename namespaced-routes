Scoping Routes
-Eventually, with direct routes that are grouped, the code becomes repetitive
-If specified routes need to be grouped under /thisgroup, Scope helps
-Scope: allows prefixing a block of routes under one grouping
*i don't have a legitimate use of this in my application but i will still provide examples*

eg: routes.rb
  scope '/admin' do
    resources :stats, only: [:index]
  end

-can reload /admin/stats and this will work correctly
-new route is resources therefore don't have to manually '/admin'
-rake routes will provide new /admin/stats and helpers _url and _path
