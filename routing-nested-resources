REST: REpresentational State Transfer, encapsulates a way of structuring a URL for access to specific resource
      is predictable

-It's a clean approach to display for URL

DYNAMIC ROUTE SEGMENTS
-Build route with dynamic segments defined in routes.rb
 eg: /beerstyle/1/beers/3
 *see routes.rb*

-To handle new filtering routes, create actions to do the work
*see beer_style_controller*

Currently
-Controller action would normally render template with same name as method, in this case leveraging templates
 already used
-routes.rb is already messy
  1. Specifying controller#actions and HTTP verbs instead of using resources :models
  2. Not DRY and no Separation of Concerns(SOC), beerstyles_controller isn't responsible for concerns
