Wristband Pattern
-Arrive a nightclub
-Bouncer checks ID
-You get a wristband after the validation
-If you leave and come back, the bouncer will most likely won't care about checking your ID but look for your
 wristband
-If you buy a drink, the bartender doesn't ask for ID, they'll look at your wristband
-Wristband proves you are legal drinking age

LOGIN SYSTEM FLOW IN RAILS
  1. user GETs /login
  2. user enters username, no password
  3. user submits form POSTing to /login
  4. sessions#create sets a cookie on user's browser by writing username into session hash
  5. the user is logged in, session[:username] holds their username

SessionsController and routes mapping

class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    #nothing to do here
  end

  def create
    session[:username] = params[:username]
    redirect_to '/'
  end
end

routes.rb
get '/login'
post '/login'

-Currently no way to log out, you'll have to delete cookie from browser
-make small login for in new.html.erb
  <form method='post'>
    <input name='username'>
    <input type='submit' value='login'>
  </form>

-Usually form_for @user would be created but User model isn't created

LOGGING OUT
-Logout flow is even simpler
-add a #destroy action to clear username out of session
  def destroy
    session.delete :username
  end

-common route is to post '/logout' meaning logout link is a submit button that is styled to look like a link
-GET attachment doesn't change anything, logging out DOES change something therefore POST is used for change
-don't want to have a URL of http://www.yoursite.com/logout
