MVC: created as general purpose solution designed to bridge gap between user's mental model and computer's
     actual implementation
     -Helps separate concerns

VIEW: interface a user would interact with, what they read, click, hear, what flashes at them, etc
MODEL: actual data resides and is altered
CONTROLLER: manages communication between model and view, takes model info and preps for view and vice versa
