RAILS CONTROLLER CONVENTIONS
Rails conventions separate logic for rendering from action that manages DB record alteration
-new controller action simply renders new form
-create action actually processes data insertion into DB

-EDIT: will render edit form
-UPDATE: will methodically process updates for DB record itself


#routes.rb
get '/dogs/:id/edit', to: 'dogs#edit', as: :edit_dog

patch 'dogs/:id' to: 'dogs#update'

resources :dogs, only[:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]
