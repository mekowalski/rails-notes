form_tag: helper method allows automatic generation of HTML and data integration to both auto-fill values
  -and submit data to the controller to create/update a record in DB
  -allows passing in route for where params of form will be sent, the HTTP method utilized and attr for each
  field

  ISSUES with FORM_TAG
  -form manually passed to the route where params will be submitted
  -form has no knowledge of goal, doesn't know if form is meant for updating/creating record
  -duplicate code throughout form not adhering to DRY principles

form_for: accepts instance of model as argument, uses arg to make many assumptions
  -yields an object class FormBuilder
  -automatically knows standard route for form data following RESTful convention
  -gives option to dynamically change submit button text

Rule of thumb for FORM_FOR
-when form directly connects to a model
-simple need on HTML form generated(search or contact form)

-FORM_FOR: creates a form specifically for a model object
  -automatically performs route lookup to find right URL
