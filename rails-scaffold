SCAFFOLD G
-Not ideal for a production application but can be great reference for how to build CRUD functionality
-Goes beyond backend functionality(migrations, controllers, resources) creating both front/back end code
  (CRUD features)
-Builds entire CRUD based feature without programmer writing a single line of code
-Migration, Model files, Controller, View Templates for each controller#action, full set of RESTful routes,
  and every other functional CRUD component
-Not ideal because Scaffold creates so many files that can be hard to manage

Scaffold can elegantly implement solution to remove dupe code
eg: before_action :set_article, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
-Returns class instance variable that each controller actions will automatically have because of before_action
