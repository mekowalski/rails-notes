Strong Params: ensure that when a form is submitted, only the field wanted will get by
-Rails needs to be told which params are allowed to be submitted through form to DB
-Default is to let nothing through

PERMIT vs REQUIRE
Permit: is looser, means params hash may have whatever keys are in it, if it doesn't have one of the keys,
  -it's not an issue it just won't accept other keys

Require: most restrictive, params that get passed in must contain a key if not included it fails and you'll
  -get an error

Keeping strong params DRY
-with standard CRUD setup, implementation of same code is present
-therefore abstract strong params into its own private method in the controller
-make a change and both methods(#create & #update) will automatically be able to have proper attr whitelisted

private
def beer_params
  params.require(:beer).permit(:name, :description, :abv, :location)
end
