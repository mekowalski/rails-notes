Filter by certain attributes
-Add controls to the view to manage filter
*see beers/index.html.erb*
-At this point, form is present in browser view but nothing occurs when an instance is selected and Filter is
 clicked

-Take action and write code to do filtering
*beers/index.html.erb at top*
 <% if !params[:beer].blank? %>
   <% @beers = Beer.where(beer_style: params[:beer_style]) %>
 <% end %>
