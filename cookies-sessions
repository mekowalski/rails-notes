Cookies: HTTP server asking browser to store a bit of data and retrieve that data later
  -Used for login, providing way to verify user once and remembering for the entire session
  -Without cookies, providing login information is needed for every server request
  -May also store other info such as shopping cart items, what ads have been shown

Fundamental Thinking
-When a user requests to see their account/profile/posts/shopping bag etc, how do you tell them apart from
 another user and make sure it's their correct request
eg: request flow
  -User adds a new entry to their list
   POST request to /list
  -Later, when User wants to see their list
   GET request to /list
  -What's included in HTTP request
    1. HTTP verb : get, post, put
    2. a path
    3. various headers

-HTTP servers commonly stateless, receive, process and return request of data
-GET requests usually encodes info in the patch
  eg: /lists/:list_id
  -Telling Rails to pull value id from request path and save it in params[:id] in controller

  def show
    @list = List.find(params[:list_id])
  end
  -this then loads that list from the DB and returns it as AR model object for views rendered
