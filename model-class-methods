Filter by certain attributes
-Add controls to the view to manage filter
*see beers/index.html.erb*
-At this point, form is present in browser view but nothing occurs when an instance is selected and Filter is
 clicked

-Take action and write code to do filtering
*beers/index.html.erb at top*
 <% if !params[:beer].blank? %>
   <% @beers = Beer.where(beer_style: params[:beer_style]) %>
 <% end %>

^^^this is not helpful at all for me. i don't know why i'm using this
^^^scratch that, it is actually working, it's the partial that i'm not in love with


Refactoring out of the View
-In MVC separation of concerns, put the code in the right place
-Currently, the beers#index view is cluttered with so much business logic
-Current red flags
  1. View directly queries DB for beers AND beer_styles
  2. View reads params which is out of the way to allow from controller
  3. View overrides @beers, which controller is already creating, doubling the DB requests

-To achieve correction:
  1. Kill/Remove/Delete Filer logic from beers/index.html.erb
  2. View shouldn't directly query DB for model association of BeerStyle
  3. The Controller should provide all the data needed
