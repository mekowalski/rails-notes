-Rails provides tools to store passwords relatively securely, if server is broken into, access to users'
 password won't occur

PASSWORD PROBLEMS
eg:
def create
  @user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
  return head(:forbidden) unless params[:password] == @user.password
  session[:user_id] = @user.id
end

-When the user row loads, provided password will be checked for equal of password stored in the DB and if
 it's set user_id in the session
-Not secure to store all passwords in DB unecrypted

HASHING PASSWORDS
-store the hashes of passwords
-Hash: number computed by feeding string to a hash function
-Hashes have a property of producing the same number given the same input
