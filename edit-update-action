RAILS CONTROLLER CONVENTIONS
Rails conventions separate logic for rendering from action that manages DB record alteration
-new controller action simply renders new form
-create action actually processes data insertion into DB

-EDIT: will render edit form
-UPDATE: will methodically process updates for DB record itself


#edit form

-Draw GET route for edit form, need to know which record to edit therefore accept :id as param
get '/dogs/:id/edit', to: 'dogs#edit', as: :edit_dog

-Draw additional route to handle UPDATE action, accepting :id param to alter
patch 'dogs/:id' to: 'dogs#update'

PUT: replace a whole resource
PATCH: send a set of changes to a resource

-Shortcut to resources in the routes file
resources :dogs, only[:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]

-Add in the controller actions
def edit
end

def update
end

-Create edit view templates in app/views/dogs/edit.html.erb
<%= form_tag dogs_path do %>
  <label>Dog name:</label><br>
  <%= text_field_tag :name %><br>

  <label>Dog Description</label><br>
  <%= text_area_tag :description %><br>

  <%= submit_tag "Submit Dog" %>
<% end %>
