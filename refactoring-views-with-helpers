DRY Code: Don't Repeat Your Code, software design principle
"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

Opposite of DRY is WET: Write Everything Twice

-Model code isn't concerned with presentation logic
-View is responsible for presentation


HELPERS
-Common methods available to views encapsulating common bit of code
 eg: link_to, text_field and text_area are all helpers
-Can also create custom helpers to solve our own issues
-Helpers are generally organized by controller
  With rails g scaffold OR rails g controller, app/helpers is provided
-More advanced, encapsulating more logic and even HTML

-Helpers are organized by controller but aren't restricted to a single controller, similar to link_to in any
 view


APPLICATION HELPERS
-application_helper is created automatically with Rails project that is related to app itself rather than
 any given model/controller
-Not concerning a single controller and applicable to entire application
