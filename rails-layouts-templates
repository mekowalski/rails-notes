LIFE WITHOUT LAYOUTS
-Across all views, the look should be consistent, perhaps with logo, nav links, search bar, footer
-You can begin your layout with an action template, but this will be copied across all views
-this is not DRY!!!

-If you need to change part of a template, you'll have to change it multiple times in multiple files
(not thank you)


LAYOUTS TO THE RESCUE
-Rails layouts are enabled by default when generating new Rails app
---> in beer-log app: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

YIELD
-code new layout from scratch with doctyle html, html, head and body
-
