PARTIALS
-View level files that only form one part of HTML page
-Helps to DRY code and add better organization to code in views
-Duplication is twice the amount of code to maintain, twice opportunities for bugs and non-consistent
 interface with forms

1. Create file in app/views/beers/ called _form.html.erb
   *see app/views/beers*
2. Remove(copy) dupe code from both new and edit form files
3. Paste dupe code into _form.html.erb
4. new and edit should have render 'form'

THINGS TO NOTE
1. duplicate code with <% end %> in new and edit form and not moved into the partial
  ^^^this did not work for me. i had to include <% end %> in my partial. i want to think it's because i have
  a form_for and not a form_tag, which lesson states is the case
