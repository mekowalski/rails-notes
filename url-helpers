Paths vs Route Helpers
-Meeting up with friends at El Moro, two options on how to get there
  1. Walk on the streets to El Moro
  2. Take a cab to El Moro

-walking: similar to hard-coded route paths, technically can work
 slow, potentially error-prone(1 wrong turn can lead to to different part or town)
 if location changes, requires a bit more manual work to adjust and walk to new destination
 eg: '/dogs/#{@dogs.id}'

-taxi: similar to route helper
 provide address to driver & they navigate streets for you
 faster than walking & if location changes, simple to adjust course
 eg: dog_path(@dog)

-More dynamic since they're methods & not simply strings, if something changes with route there are many
  cases where the code itself won't need to change at all
-Clean up view & controller code & assist with readability *cannot use helper methods in model files*
-More natural to be able to pass arguments into a method as opposed to using string interpolation
  eg: dog_path(dog, opt_in: true) <---more readable than
      'dogs/<%= dog.id %>?opt_in=true'
-Translate directly into HTML-friendly paths, route helpers convert any weird characters in URLs to be read
  properly by browser
  eg: &, %, ?, etc


Implementing Route Helpers
#config/routes.rb
  resources :dogs, only: [:index, :show]

-rake routes and its table
  Prefix: for route helper methods, 2 most common method types are _path & _url
  best to use _path version so nothing breaks if server domain changes
  -_path: gives relative path
  -_url: renders the full URL

  HTTP verb eg: GET, POST, etc

  URL Pattern: shows what path for the route will be & what params needed

  Controller#Action: shows controller and action with syntax controller#action
    eg: dogs#index


-Predictable names are created for route helper methods, rake routes helps you find custom paths
