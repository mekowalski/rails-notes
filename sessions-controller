Wristband Pattern
-Arrive a nightclub
-Bouncer checks ID
-You get a wristband after the validation
-If you leave and come back, the bouncer will most likely won't care about checking your ID but look for your
 wristband
-If you buy a drink, the bartender doesn't ask for ID, they'll look at your wristband
-Wristband proves you are legal drinking age

LOGIN SYSTEM FLOW IN RAILS
  1. user GETs /login
  2. user enters username, no password
  3. user submits form POSTing to /login
  4. sessions#create sets a cookie on user's browser by writing username into session hash
  5. the user is logged in, session[:username] holds their username

SessionsController and routes mapping

class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    #nothing to do here
  end

  def create
    session[:username] = params[:username]
    redirect_to '/'
  end
end

routes.rb
get '/login'
post '/login'
