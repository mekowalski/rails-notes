-Partials allow breaking up code into reusable parts, this can often lead to implicit dependencies which
 lead to bugs

-When rendering a partial from a different DIR, dependencies aren't explicitly noted
-Dependency: data the code requires in order to work(like passing variable to method)
-In application case, dependency is the instance @variable, located far away in controller
-If removing an out-of-DIR partial, the instance also needs to be removed

BEGIN
1. <%= render 'otherdir/partial' %>

REFACTOR
2. <%= render partial: 'otherdir/partial', locals: {beer_style: @beer_style} %>

-No longer passing render method a string, passing a hash with key-pair value
-First kp value contains key of locals pointing to has of variables to pass into the partial
