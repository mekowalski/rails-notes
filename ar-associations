ActiveRecord Associations are an iconic Rails feature allowing devs to work with complex networks of related
  -models w/o having to wtire lines of SQL, as long as names line up

FOREIGN KEYS
-Columns referring to primary key of another table, compromised of model name of reference and _id
  eg: beers_id
-FK's are accessible through instance methods of same name
  eg: migration
  class AddBeerStyleIdToBeers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      change_table :beers do |t|
        t.integer :beer_styles_id
      end
    end
  end
*similar to AR query: BeerStyle.find(@beer.beer_style_id)
